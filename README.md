# AWS Spot Prices For Slack: SpotBot

SpotBot allows anyone to set alarms for notification when AWS spot prices cross a threshold. For now it reports only to Slack channels, but we may add more channels and more types of alerts if there is enough interest.

The website based on Drew, A Multipurpose Landing Page Template, designed by David Rozando (http://design.davidrozando.com) contact him for licensing of the template.
